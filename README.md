# farra_constexpr
This is a compilation of handy constexpr utilities for C++23.
You can check individual usage and uses of each utility in the specific docs listed.

# Utilities
* [farra::function](docs/function.md)
* [farra::flat_interval_map](docs/interval_map.md)


# Setup
> For a header only setup you can switch to the include branch

After cloning the repo, you only need to build the project with the handy bash script.

This is the synstax for `build.sh` 
```bash
./build.sh [target, default=interval_map] [build_type, default=Release]
```
So these are all the targets available
```bash
./build.sh test #will execute the tests
./build.sh benchmark #will execute the benchmarks
./build.sh all #will execute all
```
Remember you can add Debug after the target name in order to build the debug libraries
